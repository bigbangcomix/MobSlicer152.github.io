	<h1>THE ADVENTURES OF ERASER CAT</h1>
	<h3><u>Chapter 1: Eraser Cat</u></h3>
	<p>Once upon a time there was a small creature called Eraser Cat. He was an eraser with cat ears, a cat nose, a cat mouth, cat legs and a cat tail, but he was not a cat. Eraser Cat lived on a wooden desk in a little boy’s bedroom. The little boy loved to draw and he used the eraser too much and he was starting to wear Eraser Cat down. Eraser Cat was sad because eventually he would disappear if this kept happening so he decided to run away. He had a plan. He was going to leave because he wanted to be a real cat and he didn’t want to be worn down until he disappeared.</p>
	<h3><u>Chapter 2: Pencil Dog</u></h3>
	<p>Eraser Cat made a rope out of string and tied it to the desk and then he slid down. Once he got to the bottom, he started walking and walking until he came to the next room. He went inside and found a bigger desk than his own and climbed up to the top of the desk.  It had no erasers but a big container of pencils. Eraser Cat wondered if they were alive like he was so he tried talking to them. Eraser Cat said, “Hello?  Are you there?  Can you hear me?” Then he heard all the pencils say “Shhh” so Eraser Cat walked away. But then he heard a small sound coming from under the desk and it said, “Help me! Help me!” So he went down to see who it was. When Eraser Cat got to the ground he saw a little pencil. It had the ears, the nose, the mouth and the legs of a dog. Eraser Cat said, “What’s wrong?” and he said, “I’m different from all the other pencils because I’m shorter and I get used more than them. I get left out and teased by all the other pencils. I want to be a real dog and live in a dog’s life and be happy.” Eraser Cat said, “Why don’t you come with me?  I’m going to get out of the house and become a real cat and have a cat life and be happy.” The pencil said, “What a good idea.” Eraser Cat said, “By the way, what’s your name?” “My name is Pencil Dog.” “My name is Eraser Cat. Let’s go!”</p>
	<h3><u>Chapter 3: Pen Lizard</u></h3>
	<p>Eraser Cat and Pencil Dog walked and walked until they came to another room. They went in and they found a big bed. Under the bed was a small pen and he was crying. He had the legs, the mouth, the nose and the scales of a lizard. Eraser Cat and Pencil Dog went over to see what was wrong.  The pen told them, “I was forgotten under the bed with no lid on and my ink is drying up.” Then he said, “I want to be a real lizard and have a real lizard life and I want to run around and be happy.” So Eraser Cat and Pencil Dog said, “Why don’t you come with us? We’re getting out of here and we’re going to live a real life and be happy.” The lizard said, “What a good idea.”  Eraser Cat said, “By the way, what’s your name?” and he said, “My name is Pen Lizard.” Eraser Cat and Pencil Dog told him their names and then Eraser Cat said, “Let’s go!”</p>
	<h3><u>Chapter 4: Paper Crane</u></h3>
	<p>They walked and walked until they found another room. This room had a big window at the end of it. On the windowsill was a big stack of paper. They walked up to the windowsill and climbed up.  Then they made a paper airplane out of a piece of the paper. The window was closed and they heard a small sound coming from behind the stack of paper.  They went over and looked to see what it was. It was a little paper crane and it was crying.  Pen Lizard asked, “What’s the matter?” and the paper crane said, “My wing is broken and I can’t fly anymore.” Pencil Dog said, “You can come with us, we’re getting out of here and we’re going to live a real life and be happy.” The paper crane said, “I always dreamed of being a real crane, that would be so wonderful.” But Eraser Cat said, “But we don’t have a way to open the window.” The paper crane said, “I know how to open the window,” and she whistled and all the paper cranes flew in and they all opened the window together. Eraser Cat asked her what her name was and she said, “My name is Paper Crane.” So Eraser Cat, Pencil Dog, Pen Lizard and Paper Crane climbed onto the paper airplane and the cranes helped push them out and they flew outside into the garden.</p>
	<h3><u>Chapter 5: The Pangolin</u></h3>
	<p>They landed on a huge rock. But then the rock started to move. Paper Crane asked Eraser Cat what the movement was but Eraser Cat didn’t know. There was a giant rumbling like an earthquake and then they realized it wasn’t a rock. It was an animal.  They asked the big animal what it was and it said, “I am a pangolin, what are you?” Eraser Cat, Pencil Dog, Pen Lizard and Paper Crane all told the pangolin their names.  Eraser Cat said, “We all want to be real animals.” The pangolin said, “I can help you. Hold on and I’ll take you to the animal wizard.”</p>
	<h3><u>Chapter 5: The Animal Wizard</u></h3>
	<p>They walked and walked until they got to a big cave. “This is the cave of the animal wizard” said the pangolin. “I will wait for you out here.” So then Eraser Cat, Pencil Dog, Pen Lizard and Paper Crane went inside the dark cave. Once they got in, they saw a big horse sitting on a shiny throne. The horse had a big, pointy wizard hat. They knew he must be the animal wizard. Eraser Cat asked if he could help them. The animal wizard said, “Yes I can. But first you have to tell me what you want to be.” So Eraser Cat said, “I want to be a cat.” Pencil Dog said, “I want to be a dog.” Pen Lizard said, “I want to be a lizard.” Paper Crane said, “ I want to be a crane.” The animal wizard said, “I will grant you your wishes.” He took out his magic wand and he said, “Abracadabra, tampolee ganimal, I will make each of you a real life animal!” and he waved his wand and POOF! They became the animals they wanted.  They thanked the animal wizard and they left the cave. From that day on, Eraser Cat, Pencil Dog, Pen Lizard, Paper Crane and the pangolin lived happily ever after.</p>
